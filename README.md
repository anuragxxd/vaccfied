As covid is surging in India only way to stop it is by vaccination. GOI portal for vaccine registration sucks right now. Users who are able to register but are unable to book the slots because of the shortage of the slots on the portal can now just enter their email or phone number on this app will send them a WhatsApp message or email whenever the slots are available near their respective locations within 7 days. You can register either by pincode or by your district.

This app users the goverment provide API (https://apisetu.gov.in/public/api/cowin#/) for finding the slots and sending notifications.
